Squash 'em if you can:
  * Random map generation crash, unfortunately a real pain

  * Better placement for capitols, preferably next to another friendly territory
  * Do not generate territories with less than five squares -- this is the bug the above traceback is for.
  * Zooming needs to center on mouse cursor, or at least put things in the upper left corner with higher resolutions
  * Tile size should grow by default on higher resolutions
  * Remove players with no territories from the turn list -- isn't this already done?
  * Do something to actually end the game when it is over
  * Map should be centered and not clumped in bottom right corner - this is due to the world renderer - it is only on the right when zoomed out - partly because every where else is water - this should probably be fixed - but not really a biggie right now.
  * There seems to be a bug where sometimes the game says a territory is not connected to any other when it really is - or at least it should have been removed if not...
  * More which we have forgotten.. =(
