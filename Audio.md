# Music #
Robot music!

That of course means technoish.

Should I go with "real" techno, C64 / Nintendoish / 8 bit videogame music, or something else?

# Sound #
Probably be able to manage many of the sounds with synthesizers, but perhaps not always.

Other input?

Might need to resort to freely available samples. Hopefully the theme will make this easy.
